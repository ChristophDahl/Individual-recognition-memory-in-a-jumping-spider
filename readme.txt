Introduction: 
When reading this, this project is most likely being reviewed. 
More information about the content will follow once the manuscript has been accepted for publication. 
At this stage, the data and codes provided serve the reviewing process only.

Procedure: 
(1) Load the matlab data structure: "SUBJ.mat" into your workspace. 
(2) Recreate Figure 2 from the manuscript (the main effect) by running "plottingFigure02.m". 
(3) Recalculate the data matrices used for statistical testing from raw data. That includes binning distance data and comparing habituation and dishabituation trials. To do so, run "calculateSubjectData.m". 
(4) Run the statistical tests for both experiments and the dishabituation long-term trials. The former are based on GLME, the latter on ANOVA. To do so, run "statistics.m".
