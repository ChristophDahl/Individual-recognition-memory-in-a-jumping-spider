# Individual recognition memory in a jumping spider

Authors: Christoph D. Dahl and Yaling Cheng

Introduction: This project is going to be submitted, submitted or being reviewed at this moment. More information about the content will follow once the manuscript has been accepted for publication. At this stage, the data and codes provided serve the reviewing process only.

Procedure: (1) Load the matlab data structure: SUBJ into your workspace. (2) Recreate Figure 2 from the manuscript (the main effect) by running "plottingFigure02.m". (3) Recalculate the data matrices used for statistical testing from raw data. That includes binning distance data and comparing habituation and dishabituation trials. To do so, run "calculateSubjectData.m". (4) Run the statistical tests for both experiments and the dishabituation long-term trials. The former are based on GLME, the latter on ANOVA. To do so, run "statistics.m".

Additional material: Additionally, there are supplementary videos/movies, showing individual comparisons in experiment 1 and 2 (hab. - dishab. [short-term]), and the long-term test at the end of experiment 2.

Suppl. videos 1-3: experiment 1, videos 4-6: experiment 2, videos 7-11: long-term trials after experiment 2.
